In *2006* I created a poker website (using licensed software) named **Blufftough.com**. The website never made it past testing as the *Port Authority Bill* was passed, prior to launch.

I have worked as a **casino dealer** for *10* years. I am also an **instructor** working with **Blue Ridge Comunity College**. My current endeaver is learning software development, starting with **Java**.
